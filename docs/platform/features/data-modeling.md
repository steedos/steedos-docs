Steedos Data Modeling is a fundamental feature within the Steedos platform, designed to help organizations structure, manage, and interact with their data. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and features for creating, customizing, and managing data models, allowing users to design flexible and scalable data structures for their business needs. Here's an overview of the key features and capabilities of Steedos Data Modeling:

- **Custom Data Objects**: Steedos Data Modeling allows users to create custom data objects, which serve as the building blocks of the platform's data structure. These objects represent various entities in a business context, such as customers, orders, or employees.

- **Custom Fields**: Users can define custom fields within each data object. These fields can be of various types, including text, number, date, boolean, lookup (relationships with other objects), and more. This flexibility enables users to capture and store the data needed for their specific business requirements.

- **Field Relationships**: The platform supports relationships between data objects, allowing users to create complex data models. Relationships can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, enabling users to represent intricate data structures and business relationships.

- **Custom List Views**: Steedos Data Modeling allows users to create custom list views for data objects. These views define how data is displayed and can include filtering, sorting, and field selection options, providing a tailored view of the data.

- **Custom Page Layouts**: Users can design custom page layouts to define how individual data records are displayed. This includes arranging fields, adding custom sections, and configuring page components to improve user experience and data entry.

- **Custom Buttons and Actions**: The platform enables users to create custom buttons and actions for data objects. These buttons can trigger specific actions, such as executing scripts or redirecting to other pages, providing additional functionality within the data model.

- **Custom Menus and Navigation**: Steedos Data Modeling allows users to customize application menus and navigation. This feature helps create intuitive user interfaces and seamless user experiences when interacting with data objects.

- **Business Object Modeling**: Users can design comprehensive business object models, incorporating various data objects, relationships, and customizations. This capability is ideal for building complex business applications that require detailed data structuring.

- **Integration with Other Components**: The platform supports integration with other Steedos components and external systems. This allows users to share data across different platforms and create unified business solutions.

- **Security and Permissions**: Steedos Data Modeling provides robust security features, allowing users to define permissions at various levels, including object-level, field-level, and record-level. This ensures that data is protected and access is restricted to authorized users.

Overall, Steedos Data Modeling is a versatile tool for creating and managing data models within the Steedos platform. It offers flexibility, customization, and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of business applications and data structuring needs. With its integration capabilities and security features, it provides a comprehensive solution for data modeling and management.
