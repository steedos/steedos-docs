Building applications on the Steedos platform often requires the creation of one or more custom objects to store all necessary business data. Custom objects can be considered as tables in a database, containing a series of fields where you can store data.

## Objects, Fields, and Records

In Steedos, the organization of data and functionality is based on three core concepts: objects, fields, and records.

- **Objects** are similar to tables in a database and serve as containers for storing specific types of data. In Steedos, there are two types of objects: standard objects and custom objects. Standard objects are provided by default in Steedos, such as "Organization," "Person," and "Task." Custom objects allow you to store specific information based on business needs.

- **Fields** within an object are similar to columns in a database table. They define the type of data stored in the object. For example, a contact object might include fields such as name, email, and phone number. Steedos offers a variety of field types, including text, number, date, and picklist, to accommodate different data storage requirements.

- **Records** are individual instances of data within an object, similar to rows in a database table. For example, a record of a contact object might represent one of your customers. Records contain information defined by the fields, such as the customer's name and contact details.

## Creating Custom Objects

Creating custom objects is the first step in defining the data model for your application. Below are the steps to create a custom object:

1. **Enter Settings**: Log in to your Steedos account and click the gear icon in the upper right corner to access "Settings".

2. **Object Management**: In the settings menu, select "Object Management" and click on "Objects".

3. **Create New Object**: Start the creation process by clicking the "New Object" button on the page.

4. **Define Object Properties**:
   - **Label**: Enter the display name of the object.
   - **Object Name**: Enter the unique name of the object, which will be used for APIs and development.
   - **Record Name**: Specify the name field and format (text or auto-number) for the record.
   - **Description**: Enter a description to explain the purpose and content of the object.

5. **Add Fields and Relationships**:
   - After saving the object definition, add fields to store the data for records.
   - Create relationship fields as needed to link to records of other objects.

6. **Set Security**:
   - Determine which user profiles can access the new object.
   - Set field-level security to control access to specific fields.

7. **Save and Test**:
   - Save your custom object.
   - Create, view, and edit records in the application to test the object's configuration.

8. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Make necessary adjustments to the object based on test results and user feedback.
   - Ensure the object meets the needs of business processes.

By following these steps, you can successfully create custom objects in Steedos and use them as the foundation for building powerful business applications.
