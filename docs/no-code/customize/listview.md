# List Views

View, edit, and create records from a list. List views are a great way to sort, prioritize, and analyze the records that are most important to users.

In a list view, you see only the data that you have access to. You can see records that you own, have read or write access to, or are shared with you. List views also include records owned by or shared with users in roles below you in the hierarchy. The fields you see depend on your page layout and field-level security settings.

Modify and create list views from your record home page with List View Controls Settings icon. To change and reorder the columns displayed in a list view, select Select Fields to Display. Fields correspond to columns in the final list view.
