# Record Detail Page Views

:::info Learning Objectives

* Understand the difference between default detail pages and custom pages.
* Learn how to use the **Page Designer** to adjust page layouts via drag-and-drop.
* Master layout techniques such as columns, grouping, and **Tabs**.
* **Advanced**: Configure dynamic visibility logic for fields (e.g., showing a "Rejection Reason" only when the status is set to "Rejected").

## What is a Record Detail Page?

When a user clicks on a specific row in a list (for example, clicking a "Contract Name"), the page that opens is the **Record Detail Page**.

It typically consists of three core sections:

1. **Header**: Displays the record title and key action buttons (Edit, Delete, Submit for Approval).
2. **Details**: Displays all field values of the specific record.
3. **Related Lists**: Displays child data associated with the record (e.g., payment records under a contract).

### Default View vs. Custom View

* **Default View**: A single-column form automatically generated by the system based on the object's fields. It is simple but can become difficult to navigate when there are more than 20 fields.
* **Custom View**: Built using the Amis Designer, this allows you to design layouts with multiple columns, or hide less frequent information inside tabs, much like designing a slide deck.

## Getting to Know the Steedos Page Designer

The Steedos UI engine is powered by the open-source framework **Amis**. It provides a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editor to modify your pages.

### How to Enter Design Mode

1. Open any record detail page (e.g., a specific "Project").
2. Click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the top right -> **"Edit Page"**.
3. The system will enter full-screen Designer mode.

### Designer Interface Overview

* **Left Side: Component Library**
Your "brick box." It contains layout containers (Columns, Tabs), field components (Inputs, Text), and display components (Tables, Cards).
* **Center: Canvas**
Your "workbench." This is where you drag and drop components from the left.
* **Right Side: Properties Panel**
Your "control center." Select a component on the canvas to modify its title, color, visibility conditions, etc.

## Core Components Explained

The following components are the most frequently used when designing a detail page:

### 1. Object Form

The most fundamental unit. It automatically displays the form for the selected object.

* **Tip**: In the properties panel, you can choose the specific object and even filter which fields to display.

### 2. Related List

Used to display child data related to the current record.

* **Configuration**: Drag the component in and select the **"Related Object"** in the properties (e.g., selecting the associated "Tasks" on a Project page).
* **Display Mode**: Can be shown as a **Table** or a **Card** list.

## Advanced: Dynamic Visibility (Visible On)

This is the most "intelligent" part of low-code design. We can implement complex interaction logic without writing code.

**Scenario**: Only display the "Suspension Reason" input field when the "Project Status" is set to "Paused."

1. Select the **"Suspension Reason"** field component on the canvas.
2. In the right Properties Panel, find the **"Visible"** or **"Visible On"** setting.
3. Click **"Expression Configuration"** (or enter the formula directly).
4. Write the logic:
* If the API Name of the status field is `status` and the value for paused is `paused`.
* The expression is: `this.status === 'paused'`


5. **Effect**: When the user selects "Paused," the reason box appears instantly; for any other status, it disappears.

:::tip Amis Expression Shortcuts

* `this.xxx` refers to a field in the current form.
* `===` means equals; `!==` means does not equal.
* `&&` means AND; `||` means OR.
* Example: `this.amount > 10000` (Displays only when the amount exceeds 10,000).

## FAQ


**Q: Why do I see two different "Detail Pages"?**
A: Steedos supports **"Profile-based Layouts"**.

* You can design a page for "Sales Reps" that only shows sales data.
* Simultaneously, you can design a page for "Finance Staff" that shows costs and profits.
* When saving the page, the system will ask which **Profiles** the layout should apply to.
