# Extend the Reach of Your Organization

Sometimes your users need to work with data and services that are outside your Steedos org. There’s a variety of ways you can provide seamless access across org boundaries.

## Work with External Data Sources

An external data source specifies how to access an external system. Steedos Connect uses external data sources to access data that's stored outside your Steedos organization. External data sources have associated external objects, which your users and the platform use to interact with the external data and content.
