# Deploying Steedos using Docker Compose

This document will guide you on how to deploy the Steedos platform on your server using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10.7 or higher)
2. [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or higher)
3. Ensure that server ports (such as 80, 443) are open for external access
4. If deploying Steedos Enterprise Edition, you need to obtain a license first

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Configuration File

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and fill in the following content:

<Tabs queryString="current-edition">
<TabItem label="Community Edition" value="community_edition">

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:

  steedos:
    image: steedos/steedos-community:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"        # Steedos
      - "27017:27017"  # MongoDB
      - "9001:9001"    # Supervisor
      - "6379:6379"    # Redis
    environment:
      - ROOT_URL=http://127.0.0.1 # Replace with your actual domain or IP
    volumes:
      - "./steedos-storage:/steedos-storage" # Attachments and logs
      - "./.steedos:/app/.steedos" # Installed packages

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Enterprise Edition" value="enterprise_edition">

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:

  steedos:
    image: steedos/steedos-enterprise:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"        # Steedos
      - "27017:27017"  # MongoDB
      - "9001:9001"    # Supervisor
      - "6379:6379"    # Redis
    environment:
      - ROOT_URL=http://127.0.0.1 # Replace with your actual domain or IP
      - STEEDOS_LICENSE="your_license_key_here"  # Replace with your actual license key
    tty: true
    volumes:
      - "./steedos-storage:/steedos-storage" # Attachments and logs
      - "./.steedos:/app/.steedos" # Installed packages
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Please adjust the environment variables and ports according to your actual situation.

### 2. Start Containers

In the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file, run the following command to start the Steedos and MongoDB containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

After deployment, you can verify that Steedos is running successfully by accessing `http://localhost` (or your configured address) through a browser.

## Configuration and Optimization

- **Security**: To enhance security, it is recommended to configure SSL/TLS and ensure that all communications are conducted via HTTPS.
- **Backup**: Regularly back up your MongoDB database to prevent data loss.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use Docker or third-party tools to monitor the performance and resource usage of Steedos containers.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems during deployment, check the following:

- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
- Check the Docker container logs for error messages.
- Ensure server ports are not blocked by a firewall.

## Updates and Maintenance

When Steedos releases a new version, you can update your deployment with the following steps:

1. Stop the currently running containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

2. Pull the latest Steedos image:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

3. Restart the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure you back up your data before updating.
